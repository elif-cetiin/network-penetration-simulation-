## Network Penetration Simulation (Ethical Hacking Project)

This project simulates real-world network penetration testing activities in a controlled lab environment using Kali Linux, Parrot OS, Wireshark, Nmap, and Python.

### What was done

- Executed penetration testing techniques: MAC flooding, ARP poisoning, and DoS traffic generation.
- Captured live network packets with Wireshark and analyzed attack patterns.
- Identified vulnerabilities and documented mitigation strategies.
- Performed hands-on ethical hacking labs aligned with EC-Council training (password cracking, credential harvesting, social engineering simulations).

### Tools & Technologies
Kali Linux · Parrot OS · Wireshark · Nmap · Python · VirtualBox · Git

> This repository includes: scripts used during the lab, sample PCAP analysis notes, and documentation of attack steps and defensive strategies.
